# News Headline Classification with Naive Bayes

In this repository, I use natural language processing to classify headlines into one of four categories: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. I used various natural language techniques including tokenization, stop words, lemmatization, and TF-IDF combined with machine learning techniques including Naive Bayes and hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`. The `classify.ipynb` notebook should be able to run top to bottom once you download the dataset (`train.csv` and `test.csv`) from this [link](https://github.com/mhjabreel/CharCnn_Keras/tree/master/data/ag_news_csv).
